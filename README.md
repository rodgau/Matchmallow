# Matchmallow
Cloud based massively distributed temperature sensor array project.

## Introduction
This is a combined Electric Imp firmware and Cloud hosted app project to provide temperature monitoring on a wide scale.


One sensor or 1000 sensors, on your workbench or spread over 6000 feet of factory floor; this box can do both...simultaneously.

## Status
Currently in an early development stage.
